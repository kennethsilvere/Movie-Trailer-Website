Brief overview of the implementation of this project : 

->Install Python


->Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.


->Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.


->To help generate a website that displays these movies, use the provided Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.


->Ensure the website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
